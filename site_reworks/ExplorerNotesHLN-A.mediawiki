{{Explorer Note
| title = HLN-A Discovery #1 (The Island)
| text = Take a look at this. Its a bit of flash that the other survivors must've missed. Good thing you've got ol' HLN-A following you around, right? There's a reason I'm following you around, My creator, Helena, used to be a survivor like you. If I observe you, maybe i can understand her better.

{{Explorer Note
| title = HLN-A Discovery #2 (The Island)
| text = It fascinates me how you survivors find your own solutions to problems. Stranded in a strange land with no tools? Just punch the tree! I never would have guessed that's effective. Can't wait to see what solutions you come up with in the Genesis simulation. Like... how do you build a fort on the open sea? Or in a volcanic hellscape? It's not all punching trees, mate.

{{Explorer Note
| title = HLN-A Discovery #3 (The Island)
| text = This place is dangerous! If you don't starve, the dinos will get you -- or the environment, or who knows what else. Thirty percent of survivors don't live to see a second day, and fifty-five percent don't make it past the first week. It's a little odd that they're called "survivors" when they're not so good at it. You, though? I got a feeling about you. After all, they're putting you in the Genesis simulation for a reason, eh?

| text = I don't understand how you survivors decide what to tame what to eat. Take a gander at the creatures we've seen lately. They aren't exactly cute! What makes you look at something that's all scales and fangs and say, "that one there, that'll be a right rippin' pet?" Or "I fancy that dino for brekkie this morning?" Tame 'em or eat 'em, that's your call, I reckon. Just don't let 'em eat you, eh?

{{Explorer Note
| title = HLN-A Discovery #5 (Scorched Earth)
| text = This Ark has creatures that never were, if you catch my meaning. It's not all dinosaurs from prehistory. The minds behind this Ark dug into their mythology books, not just their "Dinos for Kiddos" books. Get used to it -- you'll see some things in the Genesis simulation that never were, too. I reckon it's yet another way to keep survivors on your toes.

You drape different things over your torso and whatnot depending on whether it’s hot or cold. That’s brilliant!<br/>...but it won’t work for me, more’s the pity. Well, we better get used to the heat -- there’s a lot of it in our future.

| text = I just discovered something curious. The minds that made the Arks used them to test some of the critters that you’ll find in the Genesis simulation. My scanner tells me that an immense lizard with an internal bio-furnace was tested here.<br/>They don’t have that creature on this Ark anymore -- we’d see the scorch marks if they did. But they tested the fire lizard here before you survivors came along. I wonder why they decided to have them only in the simulation?

There’s radiation, mutant creatures, toxic gas, earthquakes -- not the lush paradise that’s supposed to be here.<br/>I’m not sure how to put this, but, uh… we didn’t do this, did we?<br/>I mean, I’ve seen you survivors mow through berry-bushes and chop through entire forests, but trash an entire Ark? That’s another level. And if you did trash this place, don’t tell me. Best I don’t know.

We have creatures in Genesis that go crazy for the stuff.<br/>Second, Element gets into a survivor’s mind, too. Helena, my creator, knew a survivor who couldn’t get enough Element. Drove him stark raving mad, it did!

Every shadowy corner or dark cave here has something lurking -- usually something that wants to eat you!<br/>I wish I could help, but Helena didn’t exactly kit me out for combat. No grenade launchers or anything like that. She didn’t even give me limbs to hold a weapon! All I’ve got is short-range scanners, diagnostic software, and a charming personality.<br/>Oh, and an extensive library of Australian vulgarities. I wonder when that’ll become relevant...

{{Explorer Note
| title = HLN-A Discovery #11 (Aberration)
| text = The background levels of Element are way higher on this Ark. I wonder whether that was part of the plan -- to see what you survivors would do with Element if you had access to it.<br/>Or maybe… maybe it’s the reverse. The plan was to see what Element would do if it had access to survivors. That’s the thing about Element: it adapts to whatever it’s in contact with. If you aren’t careful, Element can corrupt you. But I know you’ll be careful. After all, we made it this far, eh?

{{Explorer Note
| title = HLN-A Discovery #12 (Extinction)
| text = When things got really bad on Earth -- wars, Element corruption, all sorts of troubles -- humans thought of all sorts of ways to escape.<br/>One way to escape was homo deus, another step in human evolution. Another way -- from a certain point of view -- was these Arks. And the Genesis simulation was another escape plan.<br/>You survivors, though, you’re made of tougher stuff. You adapt and endure, rather than running away.

Earth’s a big place, of course, but you’d think there’d be radio signals or something to let us know we aren’t the last ones on earth.<br/>And if there are no more humans, where’d they all go? Did they do each other in, or did the titans get them? With all you humans accomplished, you’d think there’d be a remnant out there somewhere.

{{Explorer Note
| title = HLN-A Discovery #14 (Extinction)
| text = We’re pioneers, but we aren’t the first survivors to get back to Earth. Years ago, a few survivors got back -- one of whom was Helena, the survivor who made me.<br/>They saw the same devastation you’re seeing right now, and they sought their own way to escape. For Helena, that meant ascending and becoming Homo Deus -- an energy being beyond our reality. For her friends, it meant a long journey to a place called Arat Prime, where they figured out a way to beam Helena into the Genesis simulation. And then she made me!

{{Explorer Note
| title = HLN-A Discovery #15 (Extinction)
| text = Once Helena’s friends beamed her into the Genesis simulation, she made me. But then she left. I guess homo deus beings can’t stay in our reality -- or the simulation -- for very long.<br/>She gave me basic access to the simulation, but not a lot of guidance beyond that.<br/>But in watching you, I’m pretty sure what I’m supposed to do: help you out as a companion and friend. Just like Helena helped her friends, and her friends helped her. Together we’re going to master the Genesis simulation, and pass every test they give us!

You come from all over Earth -- and all over its history.<br/>I don’t know how much of it you remember, though.<br/>As for how you got into the Genesis simulation… well, your guess is as good as mine.<br/>You should be proud, though. The whole point of the simulation is to identify the very best survivors.<br/>And you’re alive right now, so you’re in the running!

Your personality and your memories are stored in huge memory banks,<br/>and then they get combined with a physical body inside the Genesis simulation.<br/>Once that combination of mind and body happens, though, you’re on your own.<br/>Well, you’ve got me, of course. That counts for something!

But all this testing is supposed to prepare you for something called “the Arrival” -- <br/>and I don’t know what that is. <br/>Whatever it is, it’s something beyond the simulation itself.

{{Explorer Note
| title = Story Glitch Discovery #5
| text = You’ve probably noticed that the Genesis simulation is a dangerous place. <br/>Just staying safe and somewhat comfortable is a challenge,<br/>and there’s always some new crisis to deal with.<br/>Apparently, that’s on purpose. The simulation is designed to keep you under constant pressure so your mind stays sharp and you learn survival skills.<br/>And it’s all in anticipation of the Arrival -- whatever that is.

Safety protocols are usually there for a reason…

{{Explorer Note

We make a rippin’ team!<br/>But the overall numbers… survivors are dying in droves.<br/>Starvation, violence, accidents, a bit of everything.<br/>This is supposed to be a survival test, but the death rate is off the charts.<br/>We’d best be careful, eh?

Most survivors just rush right back to the site of their demise, only to die all over again.<br/>It’s amusing to watch at first, but it quickly turns pathetic.<br/>Another gap… it’s related to the glitches. <br/>I’m going to set up a backup system so at least I can observe what’s happening when I get “repossessed.”

Backup versions of their minds, if you like.<br/>Not your mind, though.<br/>These were potential survivors that didn’t pass the initial assessment to be considered for the simulation in the first place.<br/>Why would anyone be mucking about with them?

Fixing that glitch gave me the chills.<br/>Strewth, everything here gives me the chills --<br/>and I’m not flesh and blood like you.<br/>Every critter in this biome has its own solution to the cold.<br/>For a sabertooth or a mammoth, it’s obvious: fur.<br/>The yutyrannus and the dodo trap warm air under their feathers.<br/>And sometimes the answer lies under the skin. The kairuku and the doedicurus have a layer of blubber to keep from freezing out here.

Some part of the environment huffed and puffed and blew their house down.

It was like taking an anaesthetic.<br/>Freezing was not so bad as people thought. There were lots worse ways to die.”<br/>Let’s not find out whether he’s right about that, eh?

Look around, survivor.<br/>Isn’t it strange that you have dinos wandering around a volcanic environment?<br/>It’s like we’re seeing the moment of their extinction.<br/>Or at least some scientists think so. They’re skeptical of the asteroid-strike theory,<br/>and they think massive eruptions like this, but lasting for centuries, might have done in all the dinosaurs.<br/>Too bad we can’t just ask them:<br/>“Oi, dino, was it a rock in the sky, or a mountain on fire?”
