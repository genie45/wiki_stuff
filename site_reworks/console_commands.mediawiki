{{Ambox|color=blue|icon=Note.png|type=Missing Content|info=This page list most console commands known, if you know more about a specific one or one not listed feel free to edit it or notify us on the [[Talk:Console_Commands|Talk Page]].}}
The commands found here can be entered in the console. This allows to do actions that aren't allowed otherwise, e.g. cheating. The console can be opened by pressing {{Key|TAB}} (on the PC/keyboard) or by entering the pause screen, and simultaneously pressing {{xbox|LB}}, {{xbox|RB}}, {{xbox|X}} and {{xbox|Y}} on the Xbox, or {{ps4|L1}}, {{ps4|R1}}, {{ps4|Square}} and {{ps4|Triangle}} on PlayStation. Alternativly works just pressing {{Key|TAB}} if you have Keyboard & Mouse mode active on consoles.

== Usage ==
Some of these commands are not available until you have authenticated yourself with the <code>enablecheats</code> command.

Commands marked with Y in the cheat column need to be prefixed with <code>admincheat</code> if used on a multiplayer server. In single-player mode you neither need any <code>cheat</code> or <code>admincheat</code> before the command nor do you need to enable cheats.

Commands that target the creature / entity in your crosshairs are marked with "Target" in the target column, and commands that affect the current player are marked with "Self". These commands cannot be used in the remote console. Console commands are not case sensitive.

Boolean parameters can be specified as either the keywords "true" or "false" or the numbers 1 or 0 (or 1.0 / 0.0) respectively. 

Any distances used in these commands are in [[Game Units]], i.e. roughly one centimeter.

You can concatenate multiple commands in one line using a vertical bar <code>|</code>. For example: <code>LeaveMeAlone | Fly</code>

All commands can be run through <code>[[Console Commands#ShowMyAdminManager|ShowMyAdminManager]]</code>

|arg4 = ForceBlueprint
|type4 = Boolean

|description = Adds the specified item (or its blueprint) to the player's inventory in the specified quantity and with the specified quality.<br/>
This is a shortcut version for <code>[[#GiveItem|GiveItem]]</code>. But instead of the complete blueprint path it is sufficient to specify only a significant part of it.<br/>
E.g. the blueprint path of the [[Tek ATV]] end in PrimalItemVHBuggy. You can use "vhbuggy" or "vhb" or "buggy" or "bugg" or "uggy" or... On the other hand "atv" will not work because it's the name of the item but not a part of the blueprint path.<br/>
For ambiguous parts you will maybe not get the item you want. Instead you get one that the search mechanism finds first. E.g. for [[Bug Repellant]] (PrimalItemConsumable_BugRepellant) you can't just say "bug" because this part is also included in "buggy". You will get the Tek ATV in this case. But "bugr" is specific enough to find definitely the Bug Repellant.<br/>
To specify items by their item number, use <code>[[#GiveItemNum|GiveItemNum]]</code>.<br/>
To give items to another player, use <code>[[#GiveItemToPlayer|GiveItemToPlayer]]</code>.

The dino isn't cheat-tamed, so still requires a saddle. The level is without taming bonus, so if you want to end with a level x you should divide that number by 1.5. E.g. you want level 150, that is 150 / 1.5 = 100. You type 100 and the result is 100 plus 50% taming bonus: 150.

The quotation marks around the type are mandatory.
