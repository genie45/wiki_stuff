{{DLC|Genesis: Part 1}}
[[Genesis: Part 1]] features several missions which can be done alone or in a group and each Mission has an Alpha, Beta, and Gamma difficulty.
There are a total of 176 Missions across the 5 simulated maps. Completing missions grant Hexagons and Reward items as well as XP. Some missions allow you to use tamed creatures, some provide a high level creature for you to use during the mission, and some do not allow creatures to be used (Tamed creatures in the mission area will automatically be put in a temporary [[Cryopod]] on the inventory of the person who initiated the mission after the mission is over. Once these temporary Cryopods are used they will disappear from the user's inventory.) Missions can be repeated as often as you want although they will reward significantly fewer Hexagons if they are repeated at the same difficulty level in a short period.

Each missions contains a Mission Terminal, for where the missions can be started. While in progress, it is inaccessible for a new mission until it is done. (Blue signals mission available, Red signals mission in progress). It is also the primary means for transferring tames and survivors across the server.

Following is a list of all available missions.

==Mission Types==
The following mission types can be found on [[Genesis: Part 1]]:
;Hunt
:A Hunt Mission is a type of mission where you follow tracks on the ground until you encounter specific {{ItemLink|Brute Creatures}} to defeat. These are marked with a dino skull with two sword symbols.
:
:'''Scoring is based on how long it took to kill the Brute Creatures and its cohorts.'''
;Race
:A Race Mission is a straight forward "follow the arrow as fast as you can" type of mission where you will be racing on a high-level dino temporarily given to you for the duration of the mission. These are marked with a flag symbol.
:
:'''Scoring is based on the time taken to clear the race.'''
;Gauntlet
:An arena style survival mission where you have to survive trough 5 rounds where zone specific dinos spawn and attack you. In this arena you cannot use your own weapons or dinos. Only arena spawned weapons are allowed during the mission, but you can use the armor you have on. All weapons spawned in the arena are capable of easily killing the zone-specific dino that spawns. Weapon ammos are unlimited for Gamma. These are marked with three dino skull symbol.
:
:None of the creatures will be able to grab you, but they can still inflict debuffs to a certain degree.
:
:'''Scoring is based on time taken to clear the entire 5 wave.'''
;Checkpoint
:HLNA will show the way to points, you will have to stop at each point for a few seconds. At each point you will have to defend yourself from wild spawning dinos. When you reach the last point, there will be a task, such as collect pollen in the Bog. After you have collected all the items, a timer will start counting quickly down, during this time you have to race to the finish line in order to get any rewards. Only all the collected resources need to get to the finish line, not all players in the mission.
:
:'''Scoring is based on time taken to reach and collect the required resources, and escape with it.'''
;Escort
:A creature will spawn nearby belonging to the tribe that started the mission. It cannot be commanded under any method, and random dinos will spawn to attack it, and sometimes anyone else present. It will sometimes pause between travel and will need to be constantly protected. At nearing the end of the escort, there are several more creatures nearby awaiting its return. These are marked with 4 arrow pointing at a shield symbol. 
:
:'''Scoring is based on how much health all the escorted dinos have leftover. Any deaths from the other escorted dinos will incur a score penalty.'''
;Basketball
:A high-level carriable dino will spawn in the middle of a court to be thrown into the hoops on the end. It respawns afterwards once it gets thrown into the hoop.
:
:'''There is no scoring system in this type.'''
;Fishing
:As the mission type states, fish for fishes that lives under the water during the mission.
:
:'''Scoring is based on how much time left.'''
;Retrieve
:A treasure hunting-style mission, requiring you to find the glowing particles on each region. Particles spawns everytime another is picked up after the first per region, and will spawn at different parts within the region every time the mission starts. The only way to track them is via following the hand hud in the middle: Green represents the right direction to look for the particles, whereas red represents the opposite.
:
:'''Scoring is based on how much time used from collecting all the treasures.'''
;Boss
:Eliminate the boss. Simple? Not so. This is a giant terminal marked with a nearly visible Hexagon exclamation mark.
:
:'''There is no scoring system in this type.'''
