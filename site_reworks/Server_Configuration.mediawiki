The ''[[ARK: Survival Evolved]]'' dedicated server has a wide variety of configuration options that control its behavior and adjust many aspects of the game. These are options that can only be set at server startup.

Most options can be specified on the command line when launching the server or in the server's configuration files. Options that must be specified on the command line are noted below.

== Command Line Syntax ==
The server is currently launched via the command line using the following syntax to specify runtime options:

 '''<executable>''' '''<map_name>'''?listen[?'''<option>'''='''<value>'''][?'''<option>'''='''<value>''']...[?'''<option>'''='''<value>'''] -UseBattleye '''[<Argument>]'''''

Following the <code><executable></code> name, options are specified as a single string with each option separated by a question mark (<code>?</code>). Most options require a value argument. Refer to the option reference below for more details.

When an option is not specified, its default value is used automatically.

For example, to launch a server that:
#shows each player a crosshair
#shows each player their position on the map
#allows players to view themselves in third person
#enforces a minimum distance between player structures built by different players and tribes
#enables BattlEye

On a Linux host:
 ./ShooterGameServer TheIsland?listen?ServerCrosshair=True?MapPlayerLocation=True?AllowThirdPersonPlayer=True?TheMaxStructuresInRange=100 -UseBattlEye

On a Windows host:
 start ShooterGameServer.exe "TheIsland?listen?ServerCrosshair=True?AllowThirdPersonPlayer=True?MapPlayerLocation=True?TheMaxStructuresInRange=100" -UseBattlEye

On Windows, quotation marks ('''"''') are used to ensure the command shell does not attempt to interpret any options itself.

== Command line arguments ==
These are the options of the server launch command. For the syntax see above. Options starting with a ? (question mark) are appended directly one after another, options starting with a - (dash) have to be noted separately.

For Single Player: Right click in your Steam client on the game's name in the Library, choose Properties, tab General, button "Set Launch Options...", enter the options. But some options won't work this way, especially these starting with a ? (question mark). Try to put them into the section <nowiki>[ServerSettings]</nowiki> of the GameUserSettings.ini (for the location of this file see [[#Configuration Files|Configuration Files]]).

|All
|Activate a whitelist only mode on the server that only lets players join if added to the allow list. Not to be confused with "Admin Whitelisting" which uses "AllowedCheaterSteamIDs.txt" to allow players to cheat. This option uses "PlayersJoinNoCheckList.txt" to allow people to join but not give them cheats. If the file does not exist in your Linux/Win64 Binaries folder, create it and add the Steam64 IDs of the players you wish to be allowed to join your server.  Path; "\ShooterGame\Binaries\Win64\" "/ShooterGame/Binaries/Linux/".
You will need to restart your server, if you add new lines to the file while it is running. You can however use "Cheat AllowPlayerToJoinNoCheck 12345678901234567" in game, to add a new player to the whitelist. This method will also save to the file, so you don't need to reboot the server.

== Configuration Files ==
Most options can also be specified in the games configuration files. The location of the configuration files varies by platform:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Platform !! Configuration File !! Location
|-
| Linux || GameUserSettings.ini || <code>ShooterGame/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/</code>
|-
| Linux || Game.ini || <code>ShooterGame/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/</code>
|-
| Windows || GameUserSettings.ini || <code>ShooterGame/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/</code>
|-
| Windows || Game.ini || <code>ShooterGame/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/</code>
|}

The '''GameUserSettings.ini''' file contains options for both the game client and the game server. Options for the game client are not used by the server. Server options are specified in the section labeled <code>[ServerSettings]</code>, which is usually located at the bottom of the file.

The '''Game.ini''' file is used for more advanced modifications, such as changing engram points or XP rewarded per level, disabling specific content, or rebalancing depending on player tastes.

For all supported platforms, options are listed one per line using the same basic syntax:

 '''<option>'''='''<value>'''

All options in the configuration file require a value. If an option is not listed in the configuration file, its default value is used automatically.

To configure a game server with the same configuration as shown in [[#Command_Line_Syntax|Command Line Syntax]] above:

 ServerCrosshair=True
 AllowThirdPersonPlayer=True
 MapPlayerLocation=True
 TheMaxStructuresInRange=100

With these options in the configuration file, the server can be launched with a much shorter command line. For Linux:

 ./ShooterGameServer TheIsland?listen

For Windows:

 start ShooterGameServer.exe "TheIsland?listen"

This directive can be specified twice in the configuration file. The first time it appears, the values provided will configure player levels. The second time it appears, the values provided will configure dinosaur levels.

Because of this, each time the directive is used, it must list ''all'' of the levels players (or dinosaurs) can reach on the server. One <code>ExperiencePointsForLevel</code> argument must appear for each desired level. Values for <code>'''<n>'''</code> must be sequential, starting from zero. Keep in mind that the last 15 levels are used for ascension, meaning that you have to put 15 extra levels in your configuration file.

The examples provided here are split into multiple lines for space considerations. In the configuration file, an entry must be placed on a single line.

Description:

Configure the status and requirements for learning an engram. For OverrideEngramEntries the <code>EngramIndex</code> argument is always required, for OverrideNamedEngramEntries the <code>EngramClassName</code> argument is always required; the rest are optional, but at least one must be provided in order for the option to have any effect. The option may be repeated in <code>Game.ini</code> once for each engram to be configured.

The examples provided here are split into multiple lines for space considerations. In the configuration file, an entry must be placed entirely on a single line. Multiple <code>OverrideEngramEntries</code> and <code>OverrideNamedEngramEntries</code> entries can be specified in the file, but <code>EngramIndex</code> and <code>EngramClassName</code> values should not be repeated across multiple entries.

For the Engram Index and Engram Class Name see [[Engram classnames]].

Examples:
 OverrideEngramEntries=(EngramIndex=0, EngramHidden=false)

 OverrideEngramEntries=(EngramIndex=1, EngramHidden=false, EngramPointsCost=3, EngramLevelRequirement=3, RemoveEngramPreReq=true)

Customizes the spawning rate for a given dinosaur type (at all dinosaur spawn points). Types with a larger <code>SpawnWeightMultiplier</code> are selected more often when spawning new dinosaurs than types with lower multipliers. When <code>OverrideSpawnLimitPercentage</code> is specified (and <code>true</code>), the type will never be spawned more than <code>SpawnLimitPercentage * 100</code> percent of the time, regardless of multiplier.

| <code>multiplier</code> || ''float'' || Default = 1.0 or see table below
|}

Allows changing the amount of stats gained for each level. 
<br/>E.g.: <code>PerLevelStatsMultiplier_Player[7]=2.0</code> would mean that weight-increase per level is 2x as much as default for players.
<br/>PerLevelStatsMultiplier_Player changes the amount for players.
<br/>PerLevelStatsMultiplier_DinoTamed changes the amount for tamed dinos.
<br/>PerLevelStatsMultiplier_DinoWild changes the amount for wild dinos.
<br/>To nearly disable gaining stats use 0.01 because setting the value to 0 makes it default to 1.0

Examples for different types effecting Health of a tamed dino: 
 PerLevelStatsMultiplier_DinoTamed[0]=1.0
 PerLevelStatsMultiplier_DinoTamed_Add[0]=1.0
 PerLevelStatsMultiplier_DinoTamed_Affinity[0]=1.0

''Introduced in patch [[202.0]]''

Default Values:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Attribute !! Wild !! Tamed !! Tamed_Add !! Tamed_Affinity
|-
| 0 Health || 1 || 0.2 || 0.14 || 0.44
|-
| 1 Stamina || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1
|-
| 2 Torpidity || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1

==== ConfigOverrideItemCraftingCosts ====
<div style="border: 1px solid silver; padding: 0 1em;">
 ConfigOverrideItemCraftingCosts=(ItemClassString="PrimalItem_WeaponStoneHatchet_C",BaseCraftingResourceRequirements=((ResourceItemTypeString="PrimalItemResource_Thatch_C",BaseResourceRequirement=1.0,bCraftingRequireExactResourceType=false),(ResourceItemTypeString="PrimalItemAmmo_ArrowStone_C",BaseResourceRequirement=2.0,bCraftingRequireExactResourceType=false)))<br/>
 ConfigOverrideItemCraftingCosts=(ItemClassString="PrimalItem_WeaponTorch_C",BaseCraftingResourceRequirements=((ResourceItemTypeString="PrimalItemConsumable_RawMeat_C",BaseResourceRequirement=3.0,bCraftingRequireExactResourceType=false),(ResourceItemTypeString="PrimalItemConsumable_CookedMeat_C",BaseResourceRequirement=2.0,bCraftingRequireExactResourceType=false)))

That's an example of how to make the Hatchet require 1 thatch and 2 stone arrows to craft. And to make the torch require 3 raw meat and 2 cooked meat to craft (because ya know, Meat Torches are the best torches!)

Every Item Class String can be found in the Dev Kit.

==== ConfigOverrideSupplyCrateItems ====
<div style="border: 1px solid silver; padding: 0 1em;">
 ConfigOverrideSupplyCrateItems=(SupplyCrateClassString="SupplyCrate_Level03_C",MinItemSets=1,MaxItemSets=1,NumItemSetsPower=1.0,bSetsRandomWithoutReplacement=true,ItemSets=((MinNumItems=2,MaxNumItems=2,NumItemsPower=1.0,SetWeight=1.0,bItemsRandomWithoutReplacement=true,ItemEntries=((EntryWeight=1.0,ItemClassStrings=("PrimalItemResource_Stone_C"),ItemsWeights=(1.0),MinQuantity=10.0,MaxQuantity=10.0,MinQuality=1.0,MaxQuality=1.0,bForceBlueprint=false,ChanceToBeBlueprintOverride=0.0),(EntryWeight=1.0,ItemClassStrings=("PrimalItemResource_Thatch_C"),ItemsWeights=(1.0),MinQuantity=10.0,MaxQuantity=10.0,MinQuality=1.0,MaxQuality=1.0,bForceBlueprint=false,ChanceToBeBlueprintOverride=0.0)))))

That's an example of how to completely override the items contained in the regular Level 3 supply crate, to contain just some stone and thatch for example. 

Since [[273.7|v273.7]] the SupplyCrateClassString also takes a part of the class name. E.g. "SupplyCrate" will override all supply crates. You can also set <code>bAppendItemSets=true</code> to add item sets to supply crates, rather than totally overriding all their items. And you can set <code>bAppendPreventIncreasingMinMaxItemSets=true</code> to dynamically increase the amount of items dropped by however many additional itemsets you add (only applies when bAppendItemSets=true).

All of the Item class strings and Supply Crate names can, of course, be found in the ARK Dev Kit and on page [[Beacon IDs]]!

==== ItemStatClamps ====
<div style="border: 1px solid silver; padding: 0 1em;">
'''NOTE:''' The command line argument <code>ClampItemStats</code> need to be set to <code>true</code> for the clamping to be enabled on your server. See [[#Command_Line_Syntax|Command Line Syntax]].
 ItemStatClamps[<attribute>]='''<value>'''

Arguments:
{| class="wikitable"
| <code>attribute</code> || ''integer'' || 
0: Generic Quality
<br/>1: Armor
<br/>2: Max Durability﻿
<br/>3: Weapon Damage Percent
<br/>4: Weapon Clip Ammo
<br/>5: Hypothermal Insulation
<br/>6: W﻿eigh﻿﻿﻿t
<br/>7: Hyperthermal Insulation
|-
| <code>value</code> || ''integer'' || The algorithm used appears to be the following:

<code><Initial Value Constant> + ((<ItemStatClamps[<attribute>]> * <State Modifier Scale>) * (<Randomizer Range Multiplier> * <Initial Value Constant>))</code>

Each items have their own specific data which can be found in the Dev Kit.
|}

For example, here are the values needed to have the same clamping as official servers for <code>Armor</code> and <code>Weapon Damage Percent</code>:
 ItemStatClamps[1]=19800
 ItemStatClamps[3]=19800

This would clamp [[Saddles]] to <code>124.0</code> armor (<code>74.5</code> for the 'tank' creatures such as [[Doedicurus]], [[Rock Elemental]], etc.), [[Flak Armor]] pieces to <code>496.0</code> armor, [[Longneck Rifle]] to <code>298.0%</code> damage, etc.

'''WARNING:''' This will permanently change the stats of any existing items so make sure to backup your current save before modifying and playing with the clamping values.

== Administrator Whitelisting ==
Players can be whitelisted as administrators on the server via their SteamID. These players can use cheat commands on the server automatically, as if they had authenticated themselves via the <code>enablecheats</code> command (described below).

To whitelist administrators, create the file <code>ShooterGame/Saved/AllowedCheaterSteamIDs.txt</code>. In the file, list each player's SteamID, one per line.

SteamIDs for all connected players can be listed in-game via the <code>cheat ListPlayers</code> command. Players can be kicked from the server (using their SteamIDs) via the <code>cheat KickPlayer</code> command. Refer to the following section for details.

'''Note:''' When this method is used, it is not necessary to specify a server administrator password. A password can still be specified, and can be used by players not on the whitelist to gain administrator privileges, but the server will function without it and will still automatically grant privileges to whitelisted administrators.

== Cross-ARK Data Transfer ==
How Cross-ARK Data Transfer works <ref>https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/forums/topic/85463-scorched-earth-technicaldetail-faq-ongoing/</ref>

1. For '''Officials''', you can 'upload' Survivors from TheIsland or TheCenter via the "ARK Tribute" option available at any Supply Crate or Tribute Terminal. You can then 'download' these Survivors onto an Official ScorchedEarth Server of that same game mode. Currently only Survivors are allowed to travel TO ScorchedEarth (they can not have any items on them), in order to keep it balanced for the time being. However, FROM ScorchedEarth you can transfer Survivors, Items, and Dinos, which you can then download (via the ARK Tribute) onto TheIsland or TheCenter. So indeed you can bring all ScorchedEarth Items, Dinos, and Survivors (and thus Scorched Earth Engrams) onto TheIsland or TheCenter to extend your capabilities there. When transferring a Survivor between ARKs using this method, Tribes should be retained. However Alliances will not be retained, and will need to be re-setup on the other side.

2. For '''Unofficial Servers''', if they wish to allow dynamic Cross-ARK Travel, they will need to run two Servers on the same box from the same directory, and then you can launch with the following commandlines:
 ShooterGameServer.exe ScorchedEarth_P?SessionName=MySession1?AltSaveDirectoryName=Save1 -NoTransferFromFiltering -clusterid=mycluster123
 ShooterGameServer.exe TheIsland?SessionName=MySession2?AltSaveDirectoryName=Save2  -NoTransferFromFiltering  -clusterid=mycluster123

(the clusterid must be the same between the servers!)<br/>
(to avoid saves from clashing each server should use distinct values for: <code>?AltSaveDirectoryName=<SaveFolderName></code>)

you also have options like:
 ?PreventDownloadSurvivors=False
 ?PreventDownloadItems=False
 ?PreventDownloadDinos=False
 ?PreventUploadSurvivors=False
 ?PreventUploadItems=False
 ?PreventUploadDinos=False

[[247.85]] added the ability to specify a common cross-server storage location that functions between multiple servers running on the same machine by adding the following launch parameter to each server:
 -ClusterDirOverride=C:/TestStorage/

3. Meanwhile, in '''singleplayer''', you can just use the "ARK Tribute" option and then go back to the main menu and host on the other map, and download your data accordingly.
