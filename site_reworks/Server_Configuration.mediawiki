The ''[[ARK: Survival Evolved]]'' dedicated server has a wide variety of configuration options that control its behavior and adjust many aspects of the game.

Most options can be specified on the command line when launching the server or in the server's configuration files at server start-up. Some however can be provided via the dynamic configuration system.

== Command Line ==
=== Syntax ===
The server is launched via command line using the following syntax to specify runtime options:

 '''<executable>''' '''<map_name>'''?listen[?'''<option>'''='''<value>'''][?'''<option>'''='''<value>''']...[?'''<option>'''='''<value>'''] [-'''<option>''' ['''<value>''']] '''[<argument>]'''''

Following the <code><executable></code> name, options are specified as a single string with each option separated by a question mark (<code>?</code>). Most options require a value argument. Refer to the option reference below for more details.

When an option is not specified, its default value is used automatically.

==== Example ====
To launch a server that:
# shows each player a crosshair
# shows each player their position on the map
# allows players to view themselves in third person
# enforces a minimum distance between player structures built by different players and tribes
# enables BattlEye

On a Linux host:
 ./ShooterGameServer TheIsland?listen?ServerCrosshair=True?MapPlayerLocation=True?AllowThirdPersonPlayer=True?TheMaxStructuresInRange=100 -UseBattlEye

On a Windows host:
 start ShooterGameServer.exe "TheIsland?listen?ServerCrosshair=True?AllowThirdPersonPlayer=True?MapPlayerLocation=True?TheMaxStructuresInRange=100" -UseBattlEye

On Windows, quotation marks ('''"''') are used to ensure the command shell does not attempt to interpret any options itself.

=== Options ===
These options may be only specified on the command line. Options starting with a ? (question mark) are appended directly one after another, options starting with a - (dash) have to be separated by spaces.

For Single Player and non-dedicated servers (only options starting with a <code>-</code> (dash) will work this way; the rest have to be configured with INI files):
* '''Steam:''' Right click in your Steam client on the game's name in the Library, choose Properties, tab General, button "Set Launch Options...", enter the options. Try to put them into the <code><nowiki>[ServerSettings]</nowiki></code> section of the Game.ini or GameUserSettings.ini files (for their locations see [[#Configuration Files|Configuration Files]]).

! Argument !! Platform !! Effect
|-
|<code>-UseDynamicConfig</code>
|All
|Enables the use of the dynamic config, if you don't provide a <code>customdynamicconfigurl</code> the server will use the default dynamic config for that platform (the one used on official server).
'''NOTE:''' Unless you force an immediate update using the [[Console Commands#ForceUpdateDynamicConfig|ForceUpdateDynamicConfig]] command. The configuration is checked every time the world is (auto)saved. When you want to "undo" the config you should be changing it back to whatever your default is, so it can be read from the updated config and thus applied. Omitting any lines will not update those options.

''Introduced in patch [[307.2]].''

|<code>-opengl</code> <code>-opengl3</code> <code>-opengl4</code>
|PC
|Any of these options forces the use of OpenGL. Note that this mode is forced on older Windows versions (Prior to Vista, XP and Server 2008). OpenGL support seems discontinued and this will most probably crash the game.
|-
|<code>-d3d10</code> <code>-dx10</code> <code>-sm4</code>
|PC
|Any of these options forces the use DirectX 10 using shader model 4. This will reduce the graphics engine to a lesser version, reducing some graphics, but raising the framerate.
|-
|<code>-d3d11</code> <code>-dx11</code> <code>-sm5</code>
|PC
|Any of these options forces the use DirectX 11 using shader model 5. This will reduce the graphics engine to a lesser version, reducing some graphics, but raising the framerate. It is uncertain how Ark handles this since the version of Unreal Engine used does not natively support DX12 and thus only Wildcard knows how the DirectX 12 selection logic was programmed. It does, however, encourage you NOT to use the <code>sm5</code> option unless you specifically wish to use DirectX 11.
|-class="redish-background"
|<code>-d3d12</code> <code>-dx12</code>
|PC
|Any of these options forces the use DirectX 12. Note the lack of the shader model version specification. This mode no longer works due the removal of D3D12RHI module from the engine.

|<code>-MapModID=#########</code>
|All
|Dedicated servers can now optionally load custom maps via ModID diectly, rather than having to specify the map name directly, using this syntax (where the <code>MapModID</code> is the Steam Workshop FileID of your custom map, and the GameModIds are the Id’s of the stacked mods you wish to use, in order).
''Introduced in patch [[193.0]].''
|-
|<code>?MaxPersonalTamedDinos=Number</code>

|-
|<code>-imprintlimit=#</code>
|
|Automatically destroys creatures exceeding the imprinting bonus limit specified, in %. It is recommended going 1% higher to catch potential floating point errors, especially when working with custom imprinting rates.
''Introduced in patch [[349.10]].''

|All
|Lots of detailed sky features are disabled, such as clouds and starry night sky. This decreases all of those but you can still have them. You still obtain the stars, the sun, and the moon.
|-
|<code>-nomemorybias</code>
|
|Reduced client game memory usage by about 600 MB system and 600 MB GPU RAM! (all meshes now stream LOD's dynamically). This could potentially have a small runtime performance impact, so to use the old method (more RAM usage but no potential performance loss), launch with this option.

''Introduced in patch [[242.0]], changed in patch [[247.999]].''
|-
|<code>?OxygenSwimSpeedStatMultiplier=1.0</code>

|<code>-USEALLAVAILABLECORES</code>
|PC
|This is an Unreal Engine parameter. It is used while compiling shaders and cooking assets (For example, the ARK DevKit). Research has to be done whether Ark compiles any shaders for the client or they're already precompiled while cooking. This is a useless option for dedicated servers and probably dubious for clients.
|-class="redish-background"
|<code>-usecache</code>
|All
|~70% faster loading speed option. Choose “Experiment Fast Load Cache” launch option. After the first few times that you start the game, the loading will be still be slow, but the third time onwards should be faster.

|<code>-exclusivejoin</code>
|All
|Activate a whitelist only mode on the server that only lets players join if added to the allow list. Not to be confused with "Admin Whitelisting" which uses <code>AllowedCheaterSteamIDs.txt</code> to allow players to cheat. This option uses <code>PlayersJoinNoCheckList.txt</code> to allow people to join but not give them cheats. If the file does not exist in your Linux/Win64 Binaries folder, create it and add the Steam64 IDs of the players you wish to be allowed to join your server. Path; <code>\ShooterGame\Binaries\Win64\</code> <code>/ShooterGame/Binaries/Linux/</code>.
You will need to restart your server, if you add new lines to the file while it is running. You can however use <code>Cheat AllowPlayerToJoinNoCheck 12345678901234567</code> in game, to add a new player to the whitelist. This method will also save to the file, so you don't need to reboot the server.

==Configuration Files==
Most options can also be specified in the games configuration files. The location of the configuration files varies by platform
<div class="widetable">
{| class="wikitable"

!Platform!!Configuration File!!Location
|-
| Linux||GameUserSettings.ini||<code>ShooterGame/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/</code>
|-
|Linux||Game.ini||<code>ShooterGame/Saved/Config/LinuxServer/</code>
|-
| Windows||GameUserSettings.ini ||<code>ShooterGame/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/</code>
|-
|Windows||Game.ini|| <code>ShooterGame/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/</code>
|}

The '''GameUserSettings.ini''' file contains options for both the game client and the game server. Options for the game client are not used by the server. Server options are specified in the section labeled <code>[ServerSettings]</code>, which is usually located at the bottom of the file.

The '''Game.ini''' file is used for more advanced modifications, such as changing engram points or XP rewarded per level, disabling specific content, or rebalancing depending on player tastes.

For all supported platforms, options are listed one per line using the same basic syntax:

 '''<option>'''='''<value>'''

All options in the configuration file require a value. If an option is not listed in the configuration file, its default value is used automatically.

To configure a game server with the same configuration as shown in [[#Command_Line_Syntax|Command Line Syntax]] above:

 ServerCrosshair=True
 AllowThirdPersonPlayer=True
 MapPlayerLocation=True
 TheMaxStructuresInRange=100

With these options in the configuration file, the server can be launched with a much shorter command line. For Linux:

 ./ShooterGameServer TheIsland?listen

For Windows:

 start ShooterGameServer.exe "TheIsland?listen"

This directive can be specified twice in the configuration file. The first time it appears, the values provided will configure player levels. The second time it appears, the values provided will configure dinosaur levels.

Because of this, each time the directive is used, it must list ''all'' of the levels players (or dinosaurs) can reach on the server. One <code>ExperiencePointsForLevel</code> argument must appear for each desired level. Values for <code>'''<n>'''</code> must be sequential, starting from zero. Keep in mind that the last 100 levels are used for ascension, chibi experience, explorer notes and rune rewards, meaning that you have to put 100 extra levels in your configuration file.

Description:

Configure the status and requirements for learning an engram. For OverrideEngramEntries the <code>EngramIndex</code> argument is always required, for OverrideNamedEngramEntries the <code>EngramClassName</code> argument is always required; the rest are optional, but at least one must be provided in order for the option to have any effect. The option may be repeated in <code>Game.ini</code> once for each engram to be configured.

The examples provided here are split into multiple lines for space considerations. In the configuration file, an entry must be placed entirely on a single line. Multiple <code>OverrideEngramEntries</code> and <code>OverrideNamedEngramEntries</code> entries can be specified in the file, but <code>EngramIndex</code> and <code>EngramClassName</code> values should not be repeated across multiple entries.

For the Engram Index and Engram Class Name see [[Engram classnames]].

Examples:
 OverrideEngramEntries=(EngramIndex=0, EngramHidden=false)

 OverrideEngramEntries=(EngramIndex=1, EngramHidden=false, EngramPointsCost=3, EngramLevelRequirement=3, RemoveEngramPreReq=true)

|-
|<code>limit</code>||''float''||Maximum percentage (among all spawns) for this type
|}

Customizes the spawning rate for a given dinosaur type (at all dinosaur spawn points). Types with a larger <code>SpawnWeightMultiplier</code> are selected more often when spawning new dinosaurs than types with lower multipliers. When <code>OverrideSpawnLimitPercentage</code> is specified (and <code>true</code>), the type will never be spawned more than <code>SpawnLimitPercentage * 100</code> percent of the time, regardless of multiplier. For example, a <code>SpawnLimitPercentage</code> of <code>0.25</code> specifies that the type will be selected for spawning no more than 25% of the time.

The examples provided here are split into multiple lines for space considerations. In the configuration file, an entry must be placed entirely on a single line. Multiple <code>DinoSpawnWeightMultipliers</code> entries can be specified in the file, but <code>DinoNameTag</code> values should not be repeated across multiple entries.

This can be used to disable specific Alpha Creatures, replace the spawns of a particular NPC (NPC=Non-player character, i.e. a dino) with that of a different NPC, or completely disable any specific NPC spawn. 

 NPCReplacements=(FromClassName="MegaRaptor_Character_BP_C", ToClassName="Dodo_Character_BP_C")

Dynamic Config:

As of [[319.14]], NPC replacements can be defined through the dynamic config. However, the syntax is slightly different. Rather than having multiple entries each defining a single replacement, it must be a single entry mapping all of them. For example (note the extra brackets):

 NPCReplacements=((FromClassName="MegaRaptor_Character_BP_C", ToClassName="Dodo_Character_BP_C"))

Any additional replacements must be mapped inside that set separated by a comma like so:

 NPCReplacements=((FromClassName="MegaRaptor_Character_BP_C", ToClassName="Dodo_Character_BP_C"), (FromClassName="Coel_Character_BP_C", ToClassName="Piranha_Character_BP_C"))

|-
|<code>multiplier</code>||''float''||Default = 1.0 or see table below
|}

Allows changing the amount of stats gained for each level. 
<br />E.g.: <code>PerLevelStatsMultiplier_Player[7]=2.0</code> would mean that weight-increase per level is 2x as much as default for players.
<br />PerLevelStatsMultiplier_Player changes the amount for players.
<br />PerLevelStatsMultiplier_DinoTamed changes the amount for tamed dinos.
<br />PerLevelStatsMultiplier_DinoWild changes the amount for wild dinos.
<br />To nearly disable gaining stats use 0.01 because setting the value to 0 makes it default to 1.0

Examples for different types effecting Health of a tamed dino: 
 PerLevelStatsMultiplier_DinoTamed[0]=1.0
 PerLevelStatsMultiplier_DinoTamed_Add[0]=1.0
 PerLevelStatsMultiplier_DinoTamed_Affinity[0]=1.0

''Introduced in patch [[202.0]]''

That's an example of how to completely override the items contained in the regular Level 3 supply crate, to contain just some stone and thatch for example. 

Since [[273.7|v273.7]] the SupplyCrateClassString also takes a part of the class name. E.g. "SupplyCrate" will override all supply crates. You can also set <code>bAppendItemSets=true</code> to add item sets to supply crates, rather than totally overriding all their items. And you can set <code>bAppendPreventIncreasingMinMaxItemSets=true</code> to dynamically increase the amount of items dropped by however many additional itemsets you add (only applies when bAppendItemSets=true).

All of the Item class strings and Supply Crate names can, of course, be found in the ARK Dev Kit and on page [[Beacon IDs]]!

|}

For example, here are the values needed to have the same clamping as official servers for <code>Armor</code> and <code>Weapon Damage Percent</code>:
 ItemStatClamps[1]=19800
 ItemStatClamps[3]=19800

This would clamp [[Saddles]] to <code>124.0</code> armor (<code>74.5</code> for the 'tank' creatures such as [[Doedicurus]], [[Rock Elemental]], etc.), [[Flak Armor]] pieces to <code>496.0</code> armor, [[Longneck Rifle]] to <code>298.0%</code> damage, etc.

'''WARNING:''' This will permanently change the stats of any existing items so make sure to backup your current save before modifying and playing with the clamping values.
</div>

== Administrator Whitelisting==
Players can be whitelisted as administrators on the server via their SteamID. These players can use cheat commands on the server automatically, as if they had authenticated themselves via the <code>enablecheats</code> command (described below).

To whitelist administrators, create the file <code>ShooterGame/Saved/AllowedCheaterSteamIDs.txt</code>. In the file, list each player's SteamID, one per line.

SteamIDs for all connected players can be listed in-game via the <code>cheat ListPlayers</code> command. Players can be kicked from the server (using their SteamIDs) via the <code>cheat KickPlayer</code> command. Refer to the following section for details.

'''Note:''' When this method is used, it is not necessary to specify a server administrator password. A password can still be specified, and can be used by players not on the whitelist to gain administrator privileges, but the server will function without it and will still automatically grant privileges to whitelisted administrators.

==Cross-ARK Data Transfer ==
How Cross-ARK Data Transfer works <ref>https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/forums/topic/85463-scorched-earth-technicaldetail-faq-ongoing/</ref>

1. For '''Officials''', you can 'upload' Survivors from any map via the "ARK Tribute" option available at any Supply Crate or Tribute Terminal. You can then 'download' these Survivors onto any Official Server of that same game mode. When transferring a Survivor between ARKs using this method, Tribes should be retained. However Alliances will not be retained, and will need to be re-setup on the other side.

2. For '''Unofficial Servers''', if they wish to allow dynamic Cross-ARK Travel, they will need to run two Servers on the same box from the same directory, and then you can launch with the following commandlines:
 ShooterGameServer.exe ScorchedEarth_P?SessionName=MySession1?AltSaveDirectoryName=Save1 -NoTransferFromFiltering -clusterid=mycluster123
 ShooterGameServer.exe TheIsland?SessionName=MySession2?AltSaveDirectoryName=Save2  -NoTransferFromFiltering  -clusterid=mycluster123

(the clusterid must be the same between the servers!)<br />
(to avoid saves from clashing each server should use distinct values for: <code>?AltSaveDirectoryName=<SaveFolderName></code>)

you also have options like:
 ?PreventDownloadSurvivors=False
 ?PreventDownloadItems=False
 ?PreventDownloadDinos=False
 ?PreventUploadSurvivors=False
 ?PreventUploadItems=False
 ?PreventUploadDinos=False
 ?noTributeDownloads=False

[[247.85]] added the ability to specify a common cross-server storage location that functions between multiple servers running on the same machine by adding the following launch parameter to each server:
 -ClusterDirOverride=C:/TestStorage/

3. Meanwhile, in '''singleplayer''', you can just use the "ARK Tribute" option and then go back to the main menu and host on the other map, and download your data accordingly.

|-
|bEnablePlayerMoveThroughAlly

|-
|AutoCreateTribes
|boolean
|true
|force players into a tribe automatically (good for prevent tribe servers (1 player))
|-
|RiderDinoCollision
|boolean
|false
|This is a new config that has been added to the game mode to minimize some pain of creatures stacking together when having follow armies, therefore making them easier to kill -- however this also means that they won't follow as easily due to having collision with their allies -- hence why we're tinkering to find the best/optimal way. For now we are not planning on enabling this on our official servers. If enabled the following occurs:
*Ridden and Possessed creatures can go through corpses, unconscious creatures, and ally tames
*AI driven creatures (so commander mode, unridden, and unpossessed) cannot go through ally tames
*AI driven creatures (so commander mode, unridden, and unpossessed) can go through sleeping creatures and corpses.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Option!!Arguments!!Effects
|-
|<code>TamedDinoClassStaminaMultipliers=(ClassName="'''<classname>'''",Multiplier=<value>)</code>
|classname = ''string'' 
multiplier = ''float'' Default 1.0
|allows overriding a tamed dino's stamina
Dino classnames can be found on the [[Creature IDs]] page.
|-
|<code>TamedDinoClassSpeedMultipliers=(ClassName="'''<classname>'''",Multiplier=<value>)</code>
|classname = ''string'' 
multiplier = ''float'' Default 1.0
|allows overriding a tamed dino's speed 
Dino classnames can be found on the [[Creature IDs]] page.
|-
|<code>DinoClassSpeedMultipliers=(ClassName="'''<classname>'''",Multiplier=<value>)</code>
|classname = ''string'' 
multiplier = ''float'' Default 1.0
|allows overriding a wild dino's speed.
Dino classnames can be found on the [[Creature IDs]] page.
|-
|<code>PreventDinoTameClassNames='''<classname>'''</code>
|classname = ''string''
|prevent dinos from being spawned E.g <code>PreventDinoTameClassNames=Yutyrannus_Character_BP_TSOTF_C </code>
Dino classnames can be found on the [[Creature IDs]] page.
|-
|<code>DinoClassDamageMultipliers=(<br/>ClassName="'''<classname>'''",<br/>Multiplier='''<multiplier>'''<br/>)</code>
<code>TamedDinoClassDamageMultipliers=(<br/>ClassName="'''<classname>'''",<br/>Multiplier='''<multiplier>'''<br/>)</code>
|classname = ''string''
multiplier = ''float'' Default 1.0
|Multiplies damage dealt of specific dinosaurs via classname. Higher values increase the damage dealt.
Dino classnames can be found on the [[Creature IDs]] page.
The examples provided here are split into multiple lines for space considerations. In the configuration file, an entry must be placed on a single line. Multiple <code>DinoClassDamageMultipliers</code> and <code>TamedDinoClassDamageMultipliers</code> entries can be specified in the file, but <code>ClassName</code> values should not be repeated across multiple entries.

Examples:
 DinoClassDamageMultipliers=(
  ClassName="MegaRex_Character_BP_C",
  Multiplier=0.1
 )

 TamedDinoClassDamageMultipliers=(
  ClassName="Rex_Character_BP_C",
  Multiplier=10.0
 )
Line breaks and spaces are here for better readability of the example. Keep it as one line in your configuration file.
