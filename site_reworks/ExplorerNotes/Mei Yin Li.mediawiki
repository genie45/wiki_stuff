今處何地 何以至此

自醒於此 吾數遍問及此事 需停也 知其然亦無助於吾 定而自問 何以存而續命 必有其法 雖之常變 然慰吾於遲疑恐懼之時

自黄巾軍大敗 吾已無所畏懼 然是日遇巨蜥 盻目相對 吾心之懼 自甚知也

| translation = Where am I? How did I arrive?<br/><br/>I have asked these questions many times since I awoke on this foreign shore, but I must stop. They do not matter. Their answers will not save me, so I will focus on a different question - how can I survive? This question always has an answer, though it is ever changing, and it has helped me find resolve in moments of uncertainty or fear.<br/><br/>Just days ago, I never thought I'd fear again. I thought my fear died with the Yellow Turbans. Yet when I see a great lizard turn its eyes on me, I know fear is exactly what I feel.

今有衣衫護具 雖襤褸簡陋 有可用之石矛 仍須鐵匠磨礪 岸汀之上 有肥鳥 其行慢 常捕之 不知此鳥何以存活於此 然幸得其肉

以矢克巨獸 有巨蜥 其耳如扇 其沫燃物 然吾之威脅 非僅獸類 昨日尋跡於沙 吾非一人也

| translation = I am armed and clothed now, though crudely. My stone spearhead makes me long for my village's weaponsmith, but it serves. I use it to hunt the slow, fat birds that wander the coast. I do not know how such creatures survive here at all, but I am grateful for the meat they provide.<br/><br/>I save my arrows for the more dangerous creatures - like the lizards with ears like fans, whose spit burns the things it touches. No, not just the creatures. They are not the only danger. Yesterday, I found footprints in the sand that were not my own. I am not alone.

憶當年 保家護民於叛亂之變 數月所得甚於先前數年 其理可用於今時 男輕女於戰時 人或狠於野獸

沙中之跡 非一人 乃三人也 見吾色變 目炬如狼之見羊 錯矣 其愚鈍而不知吾為狼也 脅之 無果 二人命喪於矢 余一人 刺之以矛 暴屍於野

岸旁地廣 不宜久留 欲存而活之 須至林中

| translation = Defending my hometown during the uprising taught me more in months than I learned in all the years before it. Among those lessons - men will always underestimate women in battle, and humans can be crueler than any animal. Both applied today.<br/><br/>The footprints I found were not from one man, but three. Their eyes changed when they saw me, like wolves discovering a lamb. They were wrong. They were merely mutts. I was the wolf. Two died to arrows after ignoring my warnings. The last to my spear. I left their bodies out in the wild.<br/><br/>I cannot stay here. The beaches are too open. To survive, I must brave the jungle.

今日大勝

行至落日 見一村落遇襲 其人騎巨蜥 執火器 殺村民 若退之 可保全己身 然尸橫遍野 不能離去 此乃獸行也

奇襲乃兵家上計 吾善用之 射蜥於喉 覆人於地 頃而以矛刺其項背 是以 待其亡 終不知何人所為

是想 應保巨蜥一命 吾可用一坐騎

| translation = Today, I scored a great victory.<br/><br/>As the sun set, I happened upon a small village on a bluff. Unfortunately, it was besieged by a man who rode a lizard like a horse and wielded a stick that spat fire. It would have been safer to retreat, but I could not ignore the bodies. This was a slaughter.<br/><br/>Surprise can be a warrior's most powerful weapon, and I wielded it effectively. My first arrow found the lizard's throat, and many more pierced the man's back once he tumbled from the saddle. He never saw his vanquisher.<br/><br/>In hindsight, I should have spared the beast. A mount would be welcome.

村民以寇之刀劍護具相贈 留吾過夜 吾大驚 竟諳其語 村人唇動異常 聽若故里之言 村人曰 皆因吾等腕上之器也 不明其意 然村人不吾欺

是夜 夢及叛變 吾為關公之副將 英勇率軍 突出重圍 夢醒 吾僅為美盈 而村人已去 雖為生人 仍痛其所失

吾須獨自前行

| translation = The surviving villagers let me claim the lizard rider's armor and weapons, and gave me shelter for the night. To my surprise, I understood them. Their mouths moved strangely, but in my ears I heard the language of my home. They say it is the work of the metal object in my wrist. I do not understand, but they had no reason to lie.<br/><br/>That night, I dreamt of the uprising, but this time I was Lieutenant Guan, lifting the siege on my village in a single, gallant charge. Yet when I woke, I was just Mei-Yin, and the villagers were gone. I am a stranger to them, but my heart feels heavier for their loss.<br/><br/>I must carry on alone.

吾听闻 村民言馴獸易 然 初試险丧吾之性命 此物为二足巨蜥 形如寇之坐骑 村民名之猛龍 然此獸壯 虽施以毒矢使之昏迷 仍能刺吾之臂 然吾及時避之

待其休憩 吾餵之以肉 其醒 訓其以武器 及其馴而服之 始覺其全身烏黑 僅小腿及馬蹄如雪白 名其烏騅 吾不信命 然覺此獸可攜吾歸之

| translation = The villagers had made taming beasts sound simple, but my first attempt was nearly my last. My prey was the same kind of two legged lizard as the raider's steed, what the villagers called a "raptor", but this one was strong. Even as my toxin laced arrows knocked him out, he was able to make one final lunge for my arm. He nearly took it.<br/><br/>Carefully, I fed him scraps of meat as he rested, and when he finally woke, I kept my weapon trained on him. Only when I was sure that he was docile did I notice his appearance - all black, save his white shins and feet. Right then, I named him Wuzhui, and while I do not believe in fate, I felt that this beast would carry me home.

猛龍日壯 隨烏騅其後 而烏騅聽命於吾 獸若無人騎則不成隊 然仍可緊密前行 久之 但凡獵於平原之上 獸群可聽吾之指令 或攻或退

烏騅及五兄弟壹堂 宛若眾兵 而吾為其帥 然僅此而已 吾非匠人 不善鍛造 亦身無他物

眾人異於我也 或有人善於造物 而不長於攻 吾或可易技與之

| translation = The raptors are improving. They know to follow Wuzhui, and Wuzhui knows to listen to me. Beasts without riders cannot maintain a formation, but they at least run close together. In time, they have even learned how to attack and retreat at my signal during our hunts on the plains.<br/><br/>Together, Wuzhui and his five brothers are like a light cavalry unit, and I am their commander. Unfortunately, they are all I really have. I am not much of a craftsman, and have few possessions.<br/><br/>Not everyone here is like me, though. There may be some who can craft but but cannot fight. Perhaps we could trade.

吾之防 妙也 赤鷹族進攻之法 有如余部 率眾獸 攜槍支 全以蠻力沖襲而來 枉顧周遭其他 未料吾之伏擊 出其不意 襲以側翼

吾大勝 恩人守信 施以利器及所需 又加眾獸以載物 每戰吾技皆有所進 吾位亦有所升 然有獸群在 技位於我 皆無所謂也 吾在意之人 皆已歸鄉 返鄉之前 得烏騅伴吾左右 足矣

| translation = The defense went spectacularly. Like many tribes, The Red Hawks relied entirely on brute force. They thought only of charging in with their beasts and their guns, with no regard for their surroundings. They never expected a sortie, much less one that came from their exposed flank.<br/><br/>Our victory was so complete that my benefactors not only rewarded me with the weapons and supplies they promised, but extra pack animals to carry them. With each battle, my skills improve and my ranks swell, if only with beasts. I don't mind that. The people that I care about are back home. Until I return, Wuzhui is enough company.

得知護送之行兇多吉少 不料途遇正規軍

所幸 吾為前鋒 識敵於先 遂信號吾軍以改線路 吾從側翼攻其不備 擾其視線 並反向撤退 縱然如此 吾兵亦大損 烏騅之眾兄弟皆有傷亡 敵軍或蠻鬥或攻之即如鳥獸散 然可見此軍紀律嚴明

此護送之隊有壹隊首 感恩吾之所為 曰常人若遇此新軍 鮮有倖存 吾將慎也

| translation = I was told this escort mission would be dangerous, but I had not expected to fight a legitimate army.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I was riding ahead of the main column and spotted them first. After signalling for the convoy to change course, I harassed the enemy from their flanks to draw their attention, then retreated in a different direction. Even that cost me. Many of Wuzhui's brothers were injured and some were killed. Previously, my enemies here fought wildly or scattered when attacked, but these men had discipline.<br/><br/>The leader of the convoy was very grateful. Apparently, few survive an encounter with this "New Legion". I should be wary of them in the future.

吾今為雇兵邪？ 先前未多思慮 而今人謂吾為雇兵 不喜此號 雇兵為利而戰 吾為生而戰 二者質不同 非也？

憶往日 吾戰而歸家 心知為何人何物而戰 亦知敵為何人 如今弗能辨也 吾本當護人以為榮 而非攻之 然何以確之

現弗能安穩定居 須戰以存生 戰以歸家

| translation = Am I a mercenary now? I had not given it much thought until I was actually called one. I don't like the title. Mercenaries fight for riches, but I'm just fighting for what I need to survive. That's different, isn't it?<br/><br/>When I fought back home, I knew who and what I was fighting for. I knew who my enemies were. Here I cannot tell. I am trying to be honorable by defending people and not attacking them, but how can I be certain?<br/><br/>I cannot dwell on it. To survive, I must fight on. To return home, I must fight on.

始馴形大獸者 吾之獸群 助之以速疾 然不足也 正所谓 纵有千擊速攻 若力微則無用 要勝新軍 需有重擊之力

有獸如巨型猛龍 頭頂有角 始馴之 速疾力大 可為主力也 待吾驯足量角猛龍 將加以巨獸

吾可寻归家之路哉

| translation = I've started to tame larger creatures. The speed of my light cavalry was beneficial, but I realized that it was not enough. A hundred swift strikes mean nothing if there is no strength behind them. To survive enemies like the New Legion, I must be able to strike with power.<br/><br/>I began with the ones that look like larger raptors, but with horns on their foreheads. They balance strength and speed well, and will serve well as the core of my forces. When I have enough horned raptors, I will add some of the giants.<br/><br/>Maybe then I'll finally have the strength to find a way home.

吾試而馴背刺巨蜥及巨型猛龍 遂欲離島尋路 然兜轉島中 不得離開 甚者 人雲島之魔障 阻人行舟離泗 防鳥高飛離島 此無關於力也 因無路歸鄉

烏騅似知我所憂 近日嘗醒而見烏騅棲於吾側 吾覺不孤寂也

| translation = I am living on an island. Worse, a cursed island.<br/><br/>When I managed to tame a great spined lizard and a giant raptor, I left the jungle to find a way out of these treacherous lands, but I soon found myself travelling in circles. Worse still, I'm told that a magical barrier prevents ships from sailing too far from the shore, and birds from flying too high to leave the island. It was never a matter of strength. There is no path home at all.<br/><br/>Wuzhui seems to sense my unease. These days, I often wake to find him nestled beside me. At least I am not trapped here alone.

良久以來 今大笑 有人自魚鄉部落而來 欲使吾護其左右 然其未呼吾名 喚曰獸林女王 听闻此 吾不禁大笑

吾覺明其所意 自探路而敗 以木樁圍小片之地而定也 當地之人皆知此乃吾隊之營 然吾不敢當女王之稱 吾之宮殿僅為茅草小屋 然較雇兵 吾尚喜女王之號 吾許受之

| translation = I laughed for the first time in weeks today. A man from a small tribe of fisherman sought to hire me, but he didn't call me by my name. He called me the "Beast Queen of the Jungle". I could not keep a straight face.<br/><br/>I suppose I understand the title. Since my failed expedition, I have staked out a small swath of land to live on more permanently, and the locals know it as my pack's hunting ground. Still, I'm hardly a queen. My "castle" is little more than a shack. I'd rather be called a queen than a mercenary though, so I may as well embrace it.

Would he accept a Beast Queen instead? Mother wouldn't approve. The other villagers were too desperate to care about my gender when I joined the fight against the Turbans, but mother never forgave me. She wouldn't even look at me now.<br/><br/>Should I mind?<br/><br/>Those were Mei-Yin's parents, from Mei-Yin's life, and sometimes I wonder if that life was even real. Maybe I was always a beast, and never a woman.

吾終尋壹獸 此獸非吾可命之 然以獸稱之仍不足矣 其乃魔也

其可怖狀 前所未見 弗敢鬥此獸也 吾若為獸林女王 其為魔獸之王

| translation = I have finally found a beast that I cannot command. No, to call him a beast is not enough. He is a demon.<br/><br/>I was stalking a pair of giant raptors, waiting for an opportunity to bring them into my pack, when he tore through the treeline to steal their kill. He dwarfed even the giant raptors in size, and in fury he surely has no equal in this world. When his foes bit at him, his eyes glowed with hatred and he struck with renewed vigor.<br/><br/>I have never seen such terror. Even I dare not challenge this creature. If I am the Beast Queen, then he is the Demon King.

She said that she was a scholar studying the creatures on this island, and that she wanted to observe my beasts. I turned her away at first, not trusting her intentions. How could I? What mad fool would bother with scholarly pursuits in a place like this? Yet she persisted, and in time I was convinced of her honesty.<br/><br/>I don't know if I made the right decision.

The questions haven't stopped, but thankfully they aren't always about things like animal feces. Sometimes we just talk about something simple, like cooking. Neither of us are very good at it, but together we've managed to make a few things that tasted better than plain meat.<br/><br/>Yet before long, my territory will be silent once more. Helena says she has to move on, and war is brewing in the south. Someone will need my sword very soon.

They were formidable before, and they've grown even stronger since we last met. Yet I have grown stronger too, and the Sharks were clearly in desperate straights.

| translation = My beasts are precisely what the Sharks lacked. Most of their martial strength lies at sea. On land, they lacked a unit with the ferocity of a true vanguard. Without that, they could merely withstand the Legion's siege, not break it.

By the time order was restored, we'd both sustained losses.<br/><br/>Clearly this was the work of the enemy, but those fools blame me for the confusion. Some even claim I torched their camp. How dare they question my honor after all I've done? Cowards! They have no right!

早該料想至此 縱吾置尊嚴於不顧 彼魯莽之繪鯊則不然 受其之命 今晨始歸吾營地之長途也

其言勿需吾之助力即可勝也 吾疑之 若無無吾前驅之獸 新軍必將其粉碎 然吾能奈其何 其若不願吾之助力 吾何以護其左右

待繪鯊滅時 吾或為目標乎 此難料也 但若使然 吾知將無救兵也 需靠壹己之力 現恐力之不足也

吾需愈發強壯 魔獸之王當為必備

| translation = I should have foreseen this. Though I put my pride aside, those audacious Sharks could not. At their behest, I began the long trek back to my own territory this morning.<br/><br/>They say that they will finish the war without me. Doubtful. Without my pack at the van, the New Legion will surely smash them to pieces. But what can I do? I cannot protect them if they do not want my protection.<br/><br/>Will the Legion come for me afterwards? I cannot say, but if they do, I know that I will receive no aid. I must rely on my own strength, and right now I fear it insufficient.<br/><br/>I need to become stronger. I need the Demon King.

其為吾之所有 大战挣扎过后 魔兽之力 已可为吾所使

此中代價巨大 為捕斯也 吾僅攜最迅速之眾獸 望以圈而囚之 終了其殺吾獸數只 若非烏騅 吾亦死於其手 然吾之烏騅快而狡 知當保持距離 亦知何時當撤 無它坐騎更精于此

明日吾當馴此魔獸之王 使其歸吾之隊 然今夜 吾將慶而祝之

| translation = He is mine. After a mighty struggle, the power of the Demon King is now mine to unleash.<br/><br/>The cost was almost too great. I brought only my swiftest beasts on the hunt, hoping to run him in circles, but even still he managed to kill many of them. Were it not for Wuzhui, he may have killed me as well, but my Wuzhui is both swift and cunning. He knew exactly what distance to maintain, exactly when to retreat. No steed could prove more true.<br/><br/>Tomorrow I must begin acclimating the Demon King to life in my pack, but for tonight, I will allow myself to celebrate.

吾智也 于飛行之獸上試此獸王之捕獵之技 當其跌落碎石之下 眼泛舊時之仇光 旋即不聽吾之號令 然不多時 其又重歸我之掌控 然觀此事仍乃兇險之極

| translation = I was wise to test the Demon King's hunting skills from atop one of my flying beasts. When he stumbled down a small rock formation, his eyes glowed with that familiar hatred and suddenly he proved deaf to my commands. In time, he calmed down and obeyed me once more, but it was a fearsome thing to witness.<br/><br/>I think I will keep him apart from the other beasts. Not only will it keep them safe, but it will calm their nerves. They have been tense since his arrival. I cannot blame them. The Demon King's power could save or doom us. I must use him with extreme care.

Helena said that she did not know if this pillar of light will behave like the other one. Yet if it does, if we are transported to some other plane to battle a monster for a mysterious key, then there's a chance that this could be the first step on the path home. If not that, then at least a path away from this island and the New Legion.<br/><br/>Technically Helena has hired me, but that small chance is payment enough.

His rage cost some of my pack their lives in the aftermath, but that was the price of victory. The price of hope.<br/><br/>The key we were rewarded with matches the one Helena already had. The means the third pillar must lead to a third key. And when combined? What then?

What beasts I had were exhausted, and the Demon King flew into a rage before I could start a retreat. When that happened, all hope was lost.<br/><br/>The last thing I remember is a sharp pain in my side. When I awoke, I was alone with Wuzhui. Both of us were covered in blood, but Wuzhui's wounds were deeper. I cannot fathom how he carried me to safety in such a state.<br/><br/>I must find a place to hide.

When she saw that most of the Legion was dead, she even tried to dissuade me from killing their leader. I knocked her unconscious. I wish her no harm but I cannot let her interfere.<br/><br/>At least she told me his name - Nerva. That is the man I will kill here, on this most fitting stage. I admit, it is beautiful.

His blood cannot lie. I suspect this command center was created by something with technology far beyond most normal comprehension.<br/><br/>In the distance I can see several worlds, one that is clearly a place I've been. I am now sure that there are more of these worlds. That scoundrel Nerva must have escaped before he could meet his death. Little does he know, I won't give up that easily, I will find him in whatever realm he travels to.<br/><br/>There is a terminal that sits upon a platform near the end of the command center. Surely, through some combination of codes, that must unlock travel to other worlds. But it does not. It only adds another foe to be slain by the Beast Queen.

It was three hundred paces away, right where I left it, and it was smoldering. The sunlight was burning it.<br/><br/>I remembered a cave that I had spotted earlier, and ran for it as fast as I could. My legs ached and smoke was rising from my armor by the time I arrived, yet I was still alive.<br/><br/>So now the sun was trying to kill me. Perhaps I was delirious, but I laughed at the notion.

Rather than risk the heat of the sun on the surface, I ventured deeper into the caverns.<br/><br/>It was a treacherous descent, but I am glad I went. This cave is larger than I could have imagined. In fact, it is hardly a cave at all. A great forest flourishes down here. It is as if this whole land is backwards.<br/><br/>However, there is one thing that is familiar to me.

I slew many of them, but more kept appearing. Even after killing the largest of them, they did not hesitate. <br/><br/>Only when I neared a strange, glowing pillar did they retreat.

I do not mind, and neither does my new companion.<br/><br/>In fact, I had just removed my bandages when I first saw him. From the branch of a great tree, he stared down at me with curious eyes. I stared back just as curiously. It looked almost like a young deer, but its fur was colorful and it glowed like a fallen star. He reminded me of the paintings I'd seen of Qilin, but he seemed too small.<br/><br/>Whatever he is, he approached me so innocently that I could not leave him behind.

So long as Xiao is with me, I need not fear them.<br/><br/>Yet Xiao's power is not an endless well. If he does not periodically extinguish his light to rest, it will fade with time on its own.

No, this beast was a true dragon, long of body with a feathery mane. It used the feathers on its arms to ride the wind and tore its prey's shell asunder with iron claws.

I could scale a mountain while carrying an egg and never break it, but also smash stone or fight a beast bare handed.<br/><br/>Once I got used to the armor, my experience as a warrior helped me learn quickly. I can already outpace Juzi in a race and beat her in the sparring ring. I try to go easy on her now. She helped me a lot so I do not wish to shame her.<br/><br/>I should call her by her proper name too, but Diana sounds too serious for a woman that laughs so much. Juzi fits her better.

I had to do much of the work and explain many things, but the others were grateful. It also let me test the limits of my armor. By now, using it is no different to me than wielding a sword, and I welcomed the challenge.<br/><br/>After the hunt, no one treats me like a child anymore, even when their tools confuse me. I suppose we all have different things that we excel at.

It is a lot of work, but I do not mind. It has been comforting to be around so many beasts again.<br/><br/>I have also taught them some lessons in close quarters combat. While their weapons are powerful, most of these people are not warriors. They have not tasted war. Juzi claims she was a soldier, but that she fought by flying metal ships through the clouds. She says she will show me how if we ever escape these caves. I doubt it, but it is nice to imagine.

I eat like them, I dress like them, and I work with them. I still struggle with their tools and I know that I can never truly be one of them, but that was true during the Yellow Turban Rebellion too. Those who I fought beside were my comrades, but I could never be a true soldier like they were. If that is my place in this village, then I do not mind staying for a while longer. It is not so bad.

The other villagers fear them lost to the terrible demons that lurk there. I refuse to believe that.

By then the light of the crystals had begun to dim, and there was no trace of her left.<br/><br/>Somehow, I know that this is the end she was seeking, and that wherever her soul may be, it is safe and content. Yet I cannot help but mourn, for now I am left alone.

| transcript = I am certain that I succeeded, and yet my hands and heart are empty. For the first time in so long, I am devoid of purpose. There is nothing to fight or run from. Is this what peace feels like?<br/><br/>When I exited the cave, I simply entered my armored giant and left. I did not have a destination in mind, just some faint instinct that perhaps I should go this way. So here I wander, alone in a land of poison and empty palaces, to no end but the one I choose.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate. The sky is so clear today. It would have been the perfect time to fulfill the promise around my neck.

| transcript = My armored giant has stopped moving, and I do not know how to fix it. I suppose I have been fortunate that it lasted as long as it did. Had it given out before we reached the tomb, I may not have been able to protect Helena.<br/><br/>If I want to carry on without it, I will need to get to work soon. I am low on supplies, and when one is surviving on their own, there is always much to be done. Food. Shelter. Safety. Maybe I will even find time to clean the blood from my face.<br/><br/>Yet for now, all I truly want to do is sleep. Perhaps I will dream of flying.

| transcript = I awoke to the sound earthshaking footsteps. A towering demon was upon me, and though I struggled against its minions on foot, my situation was desperate.<br/><br/>Suddenly, an armored giant crashed to the earth. It struck down the demon, scattered its beasts and knelt before me. From within stepped a woman with hair the color of sunset, or perhaps more aptly, a tangerine. My Juzi, my love - Diana.<br/><br/>For a moment, I thought I was dead or dreaming, but she felt too real to deny. I left her lips smeared with tears and blood, but she wouldn't let me apologize. It's just as well. I was not that sorry.<br/><br/>I do not know how or why this is possible, but neither do I care. All I know is that I am going to hold onto this feeling and never let it go. Never again.
