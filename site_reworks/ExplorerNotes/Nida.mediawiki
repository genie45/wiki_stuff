| transcript = Perri started in with another sermon about our sacred mission today when she found me modeling creature behavior for my latest sim.<br/><br/>I tried to explain that I was on break, that I wasn't doing anything wrong, but she wouldn't hear it.<br/><br/>As if I haven't had it drilled into my head over and over that the survival of all life from our homeworld depends on our sacred efforts...<br/><br/>I work as hard as anyone on the ship, so why do I keep getting shamed for having a hobby?<br/>It's not like a half-cycle spent away from soil sampling is going to jeopardize humanity's hopes of re-establishing itself on a new planet.<br/><br/>Besides, I know from the server logs that Perri played my last sim along with most of the crew.<br/><br/>What's wrong with dipping out off-shift and immersing yourself in some harmless escapism?

| transcript = I used to think it was pathetic that our ancestors couldn't come up with a better name for our homeworld than Earth.<br/><br/>But a lifetime spent digging around in synthetic loam kind of makes you appreciate how amazing it must have felt to feel solid ground under your feet.<br/><br/>We're told in historical media that people have always dreamed of sailing between the stars.<br/>After a few generations of doing just that, I'm here to say their dream is wearing thin.<br/><br/>I guess it's like that old saying about the grass looking greener on the next ring over-people on Earth must've been sure there was a better world out here someplace.<br/><br/>Maybe it is out here, but we haven't found it yet.<br/>In the meantime, I like to doodle around in the margins of Genesis, so my crewmates can plug into a simulation and experience an actual sunrise now and then.

| transcript = Life on this ship is an endless, monotonous routine.<br/><br/>All of us were raised in this place to be drones tending a hive of cocooned future colonists.<br/><br/>We've been told everything has to be just right when it's time for them to hatch and start training for planetfall, so day after day I service the capillary irrigation systems and monitor trace gas fluctuations in the atmosphere for the good of humanity.<br/><br/>I know I should be grateful to even be alive, given that all life on our homeworld went extinct.<br/>But I also know I can't be the only crew member who daydreams about faking my own death to escape this tedium.<br/><br/>Even if that meant hiding in the superstructure for the rest of my days, at least I'd be living for myself.<br/><br/>Shame on me, I guess.

| transcript = Working in the dirt was what I was born to do, at least according to my engrammatic aptitude test.<br/><br/>An artificial intelligence weighed my soul and decided it saw a future soil scientist.<br/> I do have to grudgingly admit I'm good at my day job, but my real passion is coding convincingly randomized events and reactive social intelligence simulations.<br/><br/>So that's what I'm tinkering with when I'm not feeding soil probe samples into a chromatograph.<br/><br/>I know, I know-my work to confirm nutrient transport and healthy geochemical cycling by microbial soil communities is an important part of maintaining this vital biological archive of ours.<br/><br/>The fate of humanity depends on our success, bla bla bla.<br/><br/>It's just that I envy having the kind of freedom people seemed to have in the past to follow their dreams, at least according to our library of historical media.

| transcript = I know what I saw, but I don't blame anyone for thinking I made it up.<br/><br/>I mean, I do come up with simulated fantasy scenarios in my free time.<br/><br/>But that's the thing...<br/><br/>If I hadn't been reverse-engineering Genesis simulation code, I never would have noticed these anomalies in the system.<br/><br/>We've been visited by something transhuman-I saw the evidence inside Genesis!<br/><br/>Maybe I shouldn't be leaving a record of this, but I think someone left a superluminal link open back to Arat Prime that one of them used to find us out here- one of the... Homo deus.<br/><br/>There, I put a name to it.<br/><br/>Guess there's no harm now in admitting that I've been trying to hack my way into a semi-forbidden cache of information about them in the archive.

| transcript = We weren't kept completely in the dark about our estranged transhuman cousins, but I think there's been a concerted generational effort to repress those memories.<br/><br/>Maybe our ancestors were afraid we'd see some appeal in the idea of accelerating our own evolution if we learned more about Homo deus.<br/><br/>If so, that seems silly, because there are kiloparsecs between us and the refined xenomaterial they needed to do it.<br/><br/>Historical archives say the Element War was fought over divergent ideas about how to deal with our polluted biosphere and dwindling resources.<br/><br/>Our ancestors in the Terran Federation thought they'd finally found a clean source of power for their grand geoengineering schemes to hack and repair the planet.<br/><br/>The United Republics of Earth wanted to hack themselves using that same power, and survive by becoming more than human.<br/><br/>Neither side was right.

| transcript = Here's how I discovered we'd had a visitor...<br/><br/>I noticed a really sophisticated artificial intelligence running in Genesis that wasn't native to our engine.<br/><br/>So I boxed it up and plugged myself into that box to say hello.<br/><br/>Our intruder turned out to be friendly, and curious about me. It called itself HLN-A.<br/><br/>I asked where it came from, and it told me its creator was what I would've called a Homo deus.<br/><br/>That might've made the hairs stand up on the back of my avatar's neck, if I'd bothered with that level of simulation.<br/><br/>I asked the AI if it'd been hiding onboard since before we launched, and it claimed it only came online within the last three thousand cycles or so.<br/>But how, I wondered?<br/><br/>I asked if that meant its creator was still with us.<br/>All I got was some cryptic answer about how she'd left a part of herself behind as a gift.<br/><br/>Then I got kicked from my own sim.

{{Explorer Note
| title = Explorer Note Nida 8
| transcript = After my one quick chat with HLN-A, I couldn't seem to track her down again inside the Genesis simulation.<br/><br/>It's like she'd learned how to conceal herself since our encounter.<br/><br/>Of course no one believed me.<br/><br/>For a while there, I wasn't sure I believed me.<br/><br/>Then the glitches started showing up in Genesis.<br/><br/>Patching the simulation code seemed like a low-priority concern, though it was definitely unusual.<br/><br/>But before anyone could address that situation, we started seeing cascading faults in our real world systems.<br/><br/>Things got bad enough that we had to evacuate and seal off biomes in the forward ring!<br/><br/>I'd like to think that my crewmates would circle back to taking my close encounter with a transhuman-created artificial intelligence seriously, if there was time or resources to investigate further.<br/><br/>But everyone's in full-on disaster mode now.

| transcript = I assumed at first that HLN-A was causing the system failures spreading through the rings.<br/><br/>We'd been raised to believe that people had barely escaped an Earth overrun by transhumanism and Element pollution.<br/><br/>It seemed logical to assume the AI I'd found embedded in our simulation engine by a transhuman entity would try to sabotage our mission.<br/><br/>Now that I'm looking over eyewitness reports from the affected areas, I'm less sure.<br/><br/>Why would HLN-A contaminate biomes with weird new lifeforms?<br/><br/>How would an artificial intelligence, even one created by a Homo deus, be able to rearrange the framework of the ship at the molecular level?<br/><br/>However or whyever these things are being done, we're in serious trouble.<br/><br/>I thought I'd done a good job of firewalling any access points out of Genesis, but clearly I wasn't able to shut out whatever is running wild through our systems.<br/><br/>I can't believe this is really happening.

| transcript = They're talking about detaching our ring if things keep getting worse, to try to keep our biomes uncontaminated.<br/><br/>I hope it doesn't come to that, but we have to do what we can to preserve the remaining biomes in the face of our rapidly dwindling odds.<br/><br/>I've been working on a whole system of backup automation to hopefully keep everything running as long as possible when-I mean if-we're all wiped out.<br/><br/>Our ship holds the last archival specimens of life from Earth, and there's an extinction-level event in progress.<br/><br/>I got nauseous just now while I was running microbial gas exchange models, because any stupid mistake I make could suffocate all the remaining Terran lifeforms in the universe.<br/><br/>If I forget to carry a number someplace, it could mean that no flower will ever push up through the soil and bloom again.<br/><br/>I have to get this right.

| transcript = I can't just keep running through the same research tasks while my crewmates are fighting an invasive force.<br/><br/>This morning while I was in a trench checking on our irrigation capillaries, I impulsively pried open a hatch and dropped into the drainage and reclamation system.<br/><br/>Below the bedrock, there's a maze of pipes and tunnels that extends throughout the entire ship.<br/>I used to sneak down there as a kid and wander for kilometers trying to get lost.<br/><br/>We had to memorize the schematics for these subsystems as part of our training, in case we had to repair some catastrophic failure deep in the network.<br/><br/>I remember resenting all the times I had to draw maps of those tunnels in timed tests, but all that rote memorization may end up saving my sorry life.<br/><br/>At any rate, I finally got a firsthand glimpse of what we're dealing with.<br/><br/>Not sure how I'll sleep again after experiencing it for myself.

| transcript = It's an understatement to say that being in the contaminated forward ring shook me up.<br/><br/>I've spent my whole life trying to simulate alien environments, but the first time I found myself actually inside one, I couldn't wait to escape.<br/><br/>I was having a panic attack, a rush of xenophobia, and severe vertigo all at once.<br/><br/>It was like every cell in my body was screaming that I didn't belong there.<br/><br/>As soon as I had some samples bottled up, I rushed to get back into the access tunnels to get the hell out of there.<br/><br/>That was when I saw one of those things...<br/><br/>At a distance, you might mistake it for a big cat: feline, predatory.<br/><br/>But it had strange, feathery spines like a venomous tropical fish, and its gaze was weirdly aware.<br/><br/>I was afraid to break eye contact while I felt desperately for the hatch.<br/><br/>A second and third creature appeared in my peripheral vision as I dove into the tunnel and sealed it tight behind me.
