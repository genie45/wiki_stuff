{{Explorer Note

| transcript = I remember the days spent working my claim.<br/><br/>With my own two hands, I dug my fortune from the earth.<br/><br/>Then the Anglos took that from me, along with my land and my life.<br/><br/>And so I fell into darkness, only to rise again in Purgatory.<br/><br/>There I found myself beset by monsters and demons in a delirium of otherworldly domains.<br/><br/>While I struggled toward my expiation, an angel joined me and called out words of encouragement with a woman's voice.<br/><br/>She asked me to join her in mortal combat with her adversary, but I chose to follow a second voice that promised me reincarnation and restitution.<br/><br/>And so I woke again in a celestial garden, with a shining gem set in one of my new forearms.<br/><br/>The voice of my deliverer returned then, to guide me to a set of the same magical armor I'd worn in the afterlife.<br/><br/>I knew then my trials weren't over.

| transcript = I wandered lost in that garden for some time, transfixed by its impossible sky...<br/><br/>I could see that everything around me lay on the inner rim of a gleaming wheel that arched overhead, from horizon to horizon.<br/><br/>There was another wheel alongside this one, and together they rolled through the firmament.<br/><br/>The sight of them brought back something I'd heard slaves singing in the Anglos' gold mines: "Ezekiel saw a wheel, way up in the middle of the air..."<br/><br/>Then I recalled an old image of a snake looping around to devour itself.<br/><br/>Where had I seen that...?<br/><br/>In my adult life I figured anything spiritual had long since been ground out of me, but that was before I'd been banished to purgation.<br/><br/>I quieted my mind to listen for the voices of the exalted, only to hear from another soul lost in that garden. <br/><br/>My magic helmet showed me a hidden door in the ground nearby.<br/><br/>Did I dare enter?

| transcript = I'm not proud to admit it took me a long while to work up the courage to venture underground.<br/><br/>The trapdoor led down into a sort of mineshaft, shored up with the same kind of smooth metal making up the wheel in the sky overhead.<br/><br/>Again I felt fear, before a young girl spoke to me from across the chamber.<br/><br/>At first I had trouble understanding her, but somehow her words gradually became sensible.<br/><br/>I thought I heard her call me 'conquistador', which confused me until I remembered my helmet, and removed it to set her at ease.<br/><br/>As I did that, I realized she'd said something more like 'colonizer'.<br/><br/>I resented being cast in the role of villain, but I saw that she wasn't afraid of me.<br/><br/>I told her she shouldn't have risked leading me to her hideaway, since she was alone and unarmed.<br/><br/>She waved away my concern, and introduced herself as Nida before offering something to eat and drink.

| transcript = This Nida claims to come from a long line of caretakers who lived out their lives tending their gardens in the sky.<br/><br/>She says we're under attack by some kind of invading force.<br/><br/>I was shown visions of creatures and lands twisted out of shape in the other garden-wheel.<br/><br/>I felt pathetic and weak, once I understood how far outside my own time and place I truly was.<br/><br/>Nida told me my trials in the netherworld that she called Genesis should have prepared me for our coming fight, but I was less sure.<br/><br/>Then she showed me the colossal mechanical mules the caretakers use to work the land, how those can cut through solid rock with spears of light as bright as the sun.<br/><br/>And I saw how we may not be as powerless as I'd feared.

{{Explorer Note
| title = Explorer Note Gabriel 5
| transcript = I finally asked Nida about the strange metal she calls Element.<br/><br/>I've been unable to keep my eyes off it.<br/><br/>She said it was among the strongest substances ever discovered, and that it powers nearly everything around us, from my magic armor to her giant, mechanical stryders.<br/><br/>I felt foolish for having risked and eventually given my life for a few pounds of gold, now that I see what can be done with this metal.<br/><br/>It's hard not to covet such wonders, though Nida said that their miracles came at a terrible cost.<br/><br/>She claimed Element polluted the Earth, and that now it was polluting their sky-gardens.<br/><br/>I asked if the invasive force taking over her wheels had brought this pollution with it.<br/><br/>Nida seemed surprised by my question but agreed that did seem like a strong possibility.

| transcript = That night I dreamt I was heating Nida's Element in a crucible, fixing its volatile form into material with endless potential.<br/><br/>I poured the result into a mold to cast a blade, hammering to fold the metal again and again, to strengthen it and work out its impurities.<br/><br/>As I lifted my blade to inspect its edge, I saw an unfamiliar reflection in its mirrored surface-the face of a sorcerer or cultist.<br/><br/>I looked around myself and saw that I was in a vaulted chamber of some dark catacomb, the center of its ceiling open to the bright, full moon overhead.<br/><br/>From the shadows of the chamber, a disembodied voice praised my work on the blade...<br/><br/>I woke in the warren of chambers under the garden, unsure of myself.<br/><br/>Was I a prospector bushwhacked by an Anglo mob in the country of the Mother Lode, or an ancient alchemist honing his mystic arts under the Mediterranean shore?

| transcript = Nida's been training me on the workings of the stryders wandering the gardens above us.<br/><br/>She says they follow their own will but we can break them like gigantic wild mules, and use them to storm the other wheel.<br/><br/>I try to remind myself she's a clever girl from a time long after my own, but still it irritates me when she talks down to me as if I’m some niño tonto.<br/><br/>Maybe that's why I'm not convinced that I need to help fight her invader. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I sat out the war to defend the ranchos of Alta California from Anglo invaders, and those malparidos ended up killing me for my property.<br/><br/>I have here a rare chance to revenge myself on an occupying force, even if I have no claim to these gardens or their mineral wealth.<br/><br/>Maybe I can earn a larger plot of land on whatever world we eventually settle...

{{Explorer Note
| title = Explorer Note Gabriel 8
| transcript = We ventured above ground to look for styders, and spotted two right away, roaming toward an outcropping of rocks.<br/>It was a long hike to reach them, and Nida insisted on doing it by night.<br/>For the first time, it occurred to me to wonder how there could even be day and night on these wheels.<br/>Did her people take the sun with them, when they flew off into the stars?<br/>Before we'd come topside, Nida showed me how to use her magic gear to look around in the dark.<br/>It was distracting - I'd keep stopping to gawk at things I shouldn’t be able to see at all.<br/>I took the lead since I was the one in armor, but the girl managed to keep pace with me.<br/>We caught up with the stryders while they were standing snout-to-snout, as if they were conversing somehow.<br/>They were so massive, it took my breath away to be close to them.<br/>Now I just had to trust that the girl knew how to tame those mechanical hulks.

{{Explorer Note
| title = Explorer Note Gabriel 9
| transcript = Nida stood at the feet of the colossal four-legged machines, and fiddled with some device in her hand.<br/><br/>One of the stryders dipped its head toward the ground and I made a fool of myself by jumping in front of her.<br/><br/>Even though I knew it was a machine, I'd still half-expected it to snatch her up in its metal jaws to eat her alive.<br/><br/>She shook her head at me with a smirk, and then she turned to grab handholds to haul herself up onto its neck.<br/><br/>From there, she was able to scramble up onto its back, where a sort of saddle platform folded into place seemingly from nowhere for her to stand on.<br/><br/>After a moment, the second stryder dropped its head for my benefit, but I opted to follow the girl up to where she was standing on the first one.<br/><br/>It seemed wiser to learn from her how to tame and ride these behemoths before attempting it myself.

{{Explorer Note
| title = Explorer Note Gabriel 10
| transcript = I spent the better part of the next day or two-or cycles, as Nida would say-learning from the girl, as she put a stryder through its paces.<br/><br/>High on the machine's back, we rode it uphill and into what looked like scablands riven by channels she hoped were deep enough to conceal us from view.<br/><br/>She showed me how to coax the machine into spearing canyon walls with a light bright enough to blast away rock.<br/><br/>I knew mining wasn't the point of her demonstration, but I couldn't resist asking Nida to drop the stryder's head low enough for me to climb down and inspect the rock cut for valuable ore.<br/><br/>I didn't find any trace of gold in the rubble pile, but a bright violet shard caught my eye.<br/><br/>Something made me snatch it up and hide it away before Nida could notice it.

| transcript = In my dreams that night I found myself back in the necropolis under...Alessandro?<br/><br/>No-Alexandria, on the coast of Egypt.<br/><br/>Even that deep under the city, I could smell the sea.<br/><br/>My torch lit sculpted images of double-crowned snakes, carved from the bedrock walls around me.<br/><br/>I was carrying dead weight over one shoulder-an orphan, taken from the steps of the Serapeum above.<br/><br/>The deepest halls of the catacomb were partially flooded, and cold salt water tugged at the trailing folds of my cloak.<br/><br/>A groan of confusion, and the child at my shoulder struggled in vain against the effects of the mandrake root.<br/><br/>I was confident in my dosage-she wouldn't be able to rouse herself from her delirium in time.<br/><br/>No-what was I doing?<br/><br/>I jerked awake on a canyon floor, staring up at our stryders standing watch over us, flashing their blue lights into the darkness.<br/><br/>I swore I could still feel the dream-dagger strapped to my leg.

{{Explorer Note
| title = Explorer Note Gabriel 12
| transcript = All through the next day, the unease of my dream sat with me.<br/><br/>I couldn't focus on whatever Nida was trying to tell me about the dire threat to her garden and its noble purpose.<br/><br/>We were riding giant machines across a landscape her people had managed to launch into the void, and still I was fretting over some occultist's scheme from thousands of years gone.<br/><br/>I couldn't be sure it was just a dream anymore.<br/><br/>I'd returned to that man's skin twice now, seen the light of another time through his eyes.<br/><br/>His life seemed no more remote, no less my own than the one I'd lived by the Río de los Americanos.<br/><br/>Which of these men was I?<br/><br/>Both?<br/><br/>Neither?<br/><br/>Had I really been dragged back from oblivion to fight for the people of this undreamt-of future?<br/><br/>Was I damned to skip like a stone across history for my barely-remembered mortal sins?

| transcript = Near dark, the girl was excited to show me something.<br/><br/>She'd pried open one of her hidden doors and pressed her magic device against the machinery inside.<br/><br/>I didn't follow what she tried to explain to me next...<br/><br/>Nida said I was wired to connect to a sort of game she'd made, from my time in the shadowland she called Genesis.<br/><br/>Then she did something, and all at once I was on another world, in a new body.<br/><br/>There were no wheels overhead, only a setting sun scudded with clouds.<br/><br/>I struggled to understand-had I ever truly been in Nida's sky-garden?<br/><br/>I called to her, but instead heard the voice of the angel I'd met in Purgatory.<br/><br/>The angel told me something important.<br/><br/>Then I was yanked back into reality, if this was actually reality.<br/><br/>Nida grinned at me and asked what I thought, and I got sick all over the canyon floor.

{{Explorer Note

| transcript = It wasn't too late to let go of the malice in my heart.<br/><br/>That was what the angel assured me in the dreamworld that Nida dropped me into, the one with the setting sun.<br/><br/>Speaking of Nida, the girl pouted for hours after I reacted poorly to the hallucination she forced on me.<br/><br/>I couldn't understand why she seemed to expect praise for what she'd done.<br/><br/>I don't trust my own sensations, my own memories.<br/><br/>I wonder if I've ever left perdition, if this ring of gardens might not be another breaking wheel for my infernal soul.<br/><br/>In the dark I lie awake, afraid to dream again, and wonder if this girl is some demon assigned to torment me.<br/><br/>And then his voice whispers to me, the one who woke me from Genesis and led me to my armor.<br/><br/>He tells me the angel lied.

| transcript = I was careless, and the girl found the treasure I'd been concealing.<br/><br/> I had taken out the shard of Element while she was sleeping, trying to remember what my other self had done in my dream to  fix its volatile form into workable metal.<br/><br/>I turned it back and forth in the dark.<br/><br/>Its glow was mesmerizing.<br/><br/>I must have fallen asleep trying to recover my dream-memory, and left it laying out by my side.<br/><br/>Nida warned me that the metal was dangerous to human flesh in this form, unstable.<br/><br/>She demanded to know what I was planning to do with it, if I'd cut myself with its sharp edges.<br/><br/>She scolded me like a child caught toying with fire, and I snapped at her like a wounded dog.<br/><br/>Neither of us spoke again for a long time after that.

{{Explorer Note
| title = Explorer Note Gabriel 16
| transcript = That other voice whispered to me again while Nida and I rode in silence toward the edge of the wheel.<br/><br/>It reassured me that the Element I'd recovered was my own to keep and asked why I'd let this girl draft me into fighting for a cause that was none of my concern.<br/><br/>Was I really in such a hurry to die again, after so little time back among the living?<br/><br/>We stopped to rest and eat in an alpine meadow.<br/><br/>While Nida was gathering berries I saw my moment.<br/><br/>I took advantage of the training she'd given me over the previous days to take one of the stryders and ride it away on my own for the canyonlands.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure if she'd be able to call the stryder back at a distance, but it's also possible that she decided to just let me go.<br/><br/>I was free now to use the power of this great machine of hers to my own ends.

{{Explorer Note

| transcript = I rode my stolen stryder back toward where I thought the canyons might be, searching for the vein of ore we'd found before.<br/><br/>Every so often I'd stop the mechanical juggernaut and force it to blast at the rock outcroppings, dismounting to dig through mounds of rubble looking for the telltale violet glow of pure Element.<br/><br/>It didn't take me long to realize that all my methods of reckoning direction or distance were useless in this place.<br/><br/>By night there was no polestar to follow north.<br/>In fact, all the stars were strange to me.<br/><br/>By day their miraculous miniature sun threaded the wheels on its odd, straight track with no regard for east or west.<br/><br/>I was utterly lost again in the garden.<br/>I wondered if the girl was pressing on without me, to fight the invader in the other wheel.<br/><br/>If she ever tried to find me in the immensity of that landscape, I saw no sign.

| transcript = By daylight I fumed at myself for running off on my own.<br/><br/>My pride and stubborn self-reliance has only ever brought me ruination.<br/><br/>I turned my stryder back toward where I'd left Nida, near the edges of this wheel.<br/><br/>I set aside my own desire to recover the mineral wealth I had lost once, and my half-memories of a previous life's pursuit of power.<br/><br/>There was only this moment, and this chance to do something right, for once in my miserable existence.<br/><br/>I pushed the machine to its breaking point, urging it into a full gallop toward the girl I'd abandoned to an unfair fight.<br/><br/>As I re-crossed that landscape shame gnawed at me, for the way I'd reacted to the dream she'd painted for me.<br/><br/>She'd only wanted to show me a sunset on the world I was destined to tame, far from these gardens she and her people had kept alive for a future they never thought they'd see.
